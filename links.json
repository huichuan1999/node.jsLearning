    "text": "photography is the art, application, and practice of creating durable images by recording light, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. it is employed in many fields of science, manufacturing (e.g., photolithography), and business, as well as its more direct uses for art, film and video production, recreational purposes, hobby, and mass communication.&#91;1&#93;the german newspaper vossische zeitungcode: deu promoted to code: de  of 25 february 1839 contained an article entitled photographiecode: deu promoted to code: de , discussing several priority claims – especially henry fox talbot's – regarding daguerre's claim of invention.&#91;7&#93; the article is the earliest known occurrence of the word in public print.&#91;8&#93; it was signed \"j.m.\", believed to have been berlin astronomer johann von maedler.&#91;9&#93; the astronomer john herschel is also credited with coining the word, independent of talbot, in 1839.&#91;10&#93;leonardo da vinci mentions natural camerae obscurae that are formed by dark caves on the edge of a sunlit valley. a hole in the cave wall will act as a pinhole camera and project a laterally reversed, upside down image on a piece of paper. renaissance painters used the camera obscura which, in fact, gives the optical rendering in color that dominates western art. it is a box with a small hole in one side, which allows specific light rays to enter, projecting an inverted image onto a viewing screen or paper.\nbecause niépce's camera photographs required an extremely long exposure (at least eight hours and probably several days), he sought to greatly improve his bitumen process or replace it with one that was more practical. in partnership with louis daguerre, he worked out post-exposure processing methods that produced visually superior results and replaced the bitumen with a more light-sensitive resin, but hours of exposure in the camera were still required. with an eye to eventual commercial exploitation, the partners opted for total secrecy.\nin brazil, hercules florence had apparently started working out a silver-salt-based paper process in 1832, later naming it photographie.\nthe first flexible photographic roll film was marketed by george eastman, founder of kodak in 1885, but this original \"film\" was actually a coating on a paper base. as part of the processing, the image-bearing layer was stripped from the paper and transferred to a hardened gelatin support. the first transparent plastic roll film followed in 1889. it was made from highly flammable nitrocellulose known as nitrate film.\noriginally, all photography was monochrome, or black-and-white. even after color film was readily available, black-and-white photography continued to dominate for decades, due to its lower cost, chemical stability, and its \"classic\" photographic look. the tones and contrast between light and dark areas define black-and-white photography.&#91;39&#93; monochromatic pictures are not necessarily composed of pure blacks, whites, and intermediate shades of gray but can involve shades of one particular hue depending on the process. the cyanotype process, for example, produces an image composed of blue tones. the albumen print process, publicly revealed in 1847, produces brownish tones.\nmany photographers continue to produce some monochrome images, sometimes because of the established archival permanence of well-processed silver-halide-based materials. some full-color digital images are processed using a variety of techniques to create black-and-white results, and some manufacturers produce digital cameras that exclusively shoot monochrome. monochrome printing or electronic display can be used to salvage certain photographs taken in color which are unsatisfactory in their original form; sometimes when presented as black-and-white or single-color-toned images they are found to be more effective. although color photography has long predominated, monochrome images are still produced, mostly for artistic reasons. almost all digital cameras have an option to shoot in monochrome, and almost all image editing software can combine or selectively discard rgb color channels to produce a monochrome image from one shot in color.\nrussian photographer sergei mikhailovich prokudin-gorskii made extensive use of this color separation technique, employing a special camera which successively exposed the three color-filtered images on different parts of an oblong plate. because his exposures were not simultaneous, unsteady subjects exhibited color \"fringes\" or, if rapidly moving through the scene, appeared as brightly colored ghosts in the resulting projected or printed images.\nkodachrome, the first modern \"integral tripack\" (or \"monopack\") color film, was introduced by kodak in 1935. it captured the three color components in a multi-layer emulsion. one layer was sensitized to record the red-dominated part of the spectrum, another layer recorded only the green part and a third recorded only the blue. without special film processing, the result would simply be three superimposed black-and-white images, but complementary cyan, magenta, and yellow dye images were created in those layers by adding color couplers during a complex processing procedure.\ndigital photography dominates the 21st century. more than 99% of photographs taken around the world are through digital cameras, increasingly through smartphones.\nultraviolet and infrared films have been available for many decades and employed in a variety of photographic avenues since the 1960s. new technological trends in digital photography have opened a new direction in full spectrum photography, where careful filtering choices across the ultraviolet, visible and infrared lead to new artistic visions.\nuses of full spectrum photography are for fine art photography, geology, forensics and law enforcement.\namateur photographers take photos for personal use, as a hobby or out of casual interest, rather than as a business or job. the quality of amateur work can be comparable to that of many professionals. amateurs can fill a gap in subjects or topics that might not otherwise be photographed if they are not commercially useful or salable. amateur photography grew during the late 19th century due to the popularization of the hand-held camera.&#91;53&#93; twenty-first century social media and near-ubiquitous camera phones have made photographic and video recording pervasive in everyday life. in the mid-2010s smartphone cameras added numerous automatic assistance features like color management, autofocusface detection and image stabilization that significantly decreased skill and effort needed to take high quality images.&#91;54&#93;commercial photography is probably best defined as any photography for which the photographer is paid for images rather than works of art. in this light, money could be paid for the subject of the photograph or the photograph itself. wholesale, retail, and professional uses of photography would fall under this definition. the commercial photographic world could include:\nduring the 20th century, both fine art photography and documentary photography became accepted by the english-speaking art world and the gallery system. in the united states, a handful of photographers, including alfred stieglitz, edward steichen, john szarkowski, f. holland day, and edward weston, spent their lives advocating for photography as a fine art.\nat first, fine art photographers tried to imitate painting styles. this movement is called pictorialism, often using soft focus for a dreamy, 'romantic' look. in reaction to that, weston, ansel adams, and others formed the group f/64 to advocate 'straight photography', the photograph as a (sharply focused) thing in itself and not an imitation of something else.\nthe aesthetics of photography is a matter that continues to be discussed regularly, especially in artistic circles. many artists argued that photography was the mechanical reproduction of an image. if photography is authentically art, then photography in the context of art would need redefinition, such as determining what component of a photograph makes it beautiful to the viewer. the controversy began with the earliest images \"written with light\"; nicéphore niépce, louis daguerre, and others among the very earliest photographers were met with acclaim, but some questioned if their work met the definitions and purposes of art.\nclive bell in his classic essay art states that only \"significant form\" can distinguish art from what is not art.\nthere must be some one quality without which a work of art cannot exist; possessing which, in the least degree, no work is altogether worthless. what is this quality? what quality is shared by all objects that provoke our aesthetic emotions? what quality is common to sta. sophia and the windows at chartres, mexican sculpture, a persian bowl, chinese carpets, giotto's frescoes at padua, and the masterpieces of poussin, piero della francesca, and cezanne? only one answer seems possible&#160;– significant form. in each, lines and colors combined in a particular way, certain forms and relations of forms, stir our aesthetic emotions.&#91;55&#93;in parallel to this development, the then largely separate interface between painting and photography was closed in the early 1970s with the work of the photo artists pierre cordier (chimigramm), chemigram and josef h. neumann, chemogram.  in 1974 the chemograms by josef h. neumann concluded the separation of the painterly background and the photographic layer by showing the picture elements in a symbiosis that had never existed before, as an unmistakable unique specimen, in a simultaneous painterly and at the same time real photographic perspective, using lenses,  within a photographic layer, united in colors and shapes. this neumann chemogram from the seventies of the 20th century thus differs from the beginning of the previously created cameraless  chemigrams of a pierre cordier and the photogramman ray  or lászló moholy-nagy of the previous decades. these works of art were almost simultaneous with the invention of photography by various important artists who characterized hippolyte bayard, thomas wedgwood, william henry fox talbot in their early stages, and later man ray and lászló moholy-nagy in the twenties and by the painter in the thirties edmund kesting and christian schad by draping objects directly onto appropriately sensitized photo paper and using a light source without a camera.\n&#91;57&#93;photojournalism is a particular form of photography (the collecting, editing, and presenting of news material for publication or broadcast) that employs images in order to tell a news story. it is now usually understood to refer only to still images, but in some cases the term also refers to video used in broadcast journalism. photojournalism is distinguished from other close branches of photography (e.g., documentary photography, social documentary photography, street photography or celebrity photography) by complying with a rigid ethical framework which demands that the work be both honest and impartial whilst telling the story in strictly journalistic terms. photojournalists create pictures that contribute to the news media, and help communities connect with one other. photojournalists must be well informed and knowledgeable about events happening right outside their door. they deliver news in a creative format that is not only informative, but also entertaining, including sports photography.\nthere are many ongoing questions about different aspects of photography. in her on photography (1977), susan sontag dismisses the objectivity of photography. this is a highly debated subject within the photographic community.&#91;66&#93; sontag argues, \"to photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed. it means putting one's self into a certain relation to the world that feels like knowledge, and therefore like power.\"&#91;67&#93; photographers decide what to take a photo of, what elements to exclude and what angle to frame the photo, and these factors may reflect a particular socio-historical context. along these lines, it can be argued that photography is a subjective form of representation.\nthe camera doesn't rape or even possess, though it may presume, intrude, trespass, distort, exploit, and, at the farthest reach of metaphor, assassinate – all activities that, unlike the sexual push and shove, can be conducted from a distance, and with some detachment.&#91;67&#93;photography is one of the new media forms that changes perception and changes the structure of society.&#91;68&#93; further unease has been caused around cameras in regards to desensitization. fears that disturbing or explicit images are widely accessible to children and society at large have been raised. particularly, photos of war and pornography are causing a stir. sontag is concerned that \"to photograph is to turn people into objects that can be symbolically possessed\". desensitization discussion goes hand in hand with debates about censored images. sontag writes of her concern that the ability to censor pictures means the photographer has the ability to construct reality.&#91;67&#93;",
